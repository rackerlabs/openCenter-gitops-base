# Kyverno - Base Configuration

This directory contains the **base manifests** for deploying [Kyverno](https://kyverno.io/), a Kubernetes-native policy engine that helps enforce best practices, security, and compliance through policies defined as Kubernetes resources.
It is designed to be **consumed by cluster repositories** as a remote base, allowing each cluster to apply **custom overrides** as needed.

## Public Repository Scope

- This public repository contains the **community/base** Kyverno policy engine deployment only.
- Enterprise-specific values, chart source changes, and enterprise-only resources must be delivered from a **private enterprise repository** as an overlay/component on top of this base.

## Kyverno

- Allows defining and enforcing **policies as Kubernetes resources** without requiring custom programming or external policy languages.
- Enables automatic configuration management, for example injecting labels, enforcing naming conventions, or setting security contexts.
- Integrates with **Admission Webhooks** to evaluate policies in real time during resource creation or modification.
- Provides **policy reports** and integrates with tools like **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for monitoring violations.
- Commonly used to implement governance, security, and multi-tenancy controls in Kubernetes clusters.
- Simplifies cluster compliance and enhances operational security through policy-driven automation.
